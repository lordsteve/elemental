## Elemental

Get the documentation [right here](https://elemental.thegreenasterisk.com).

This is a boilerplate framework for working with node and Typescript. The intention here is to use this to build apps without having to learn any extra syntax like jQuery or React or Laravel or Entity Framework. If you know Typescript, you can use this boilerplate.

On the front end, the idea is to use Typescript to directly manipulate the DOM, and to create an easy way to understand how to do that. That's where the name comes from: manipulating DOM Elements. There should be no syntax here that is unique to Elemental. Rather, Elemental should provide an easy way of understanding how the existing TypeScript syntax could be utilized and organized to create an app.

This will never be a finished project, so feel free to hop in and help develop this!

Just clone this repo and then
`npm install`
`npm run dev`

Elemental is optimized for use with external APIs utilizing the built-in Request service. Should you require your app to directly interface with a database, it also implements [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) which you can learn all about at that link.
