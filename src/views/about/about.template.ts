            <p>
                The purpose of Elemental is to provide an easy-to-use template for working with TypeScript. You will find Typescript from the back end to the front end and even providing the HTML structure. If you are using VS Code, I recommend using <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lehwark.htmx-literals" target="_blank">htmx-literals</a> for syntax highlighting.
            </p>
            <p>
                The concept of Elemental is to use TypeScript to directly manipulate the DOM without the need for learning the syntax of a new framework like Angular or JQuery. Everything you see here will be a native function of either JavaScript or TypeScript (or CSS, I guess; we let it do its thing). This is a great way to learn how to work with TypeScript and the DOM. You can use Elemental as a starting point for your project or as a learning tool.
